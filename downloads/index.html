                    Pigs that are not only breedable, but can be bred with dogs too! They also have the original pig personality values.
                    Remember to replace the original pig file after breeding/adopting or your pigs won't have the special pig behavior!

                    I redid my breedable bunnies to be anatomically closer to the pfm bunnies. These ones look a lot better if you breed them with a cat.
                    Make sure to replace the original bunny file after breeding/adopting so bunnies will get their bunny animations back!

                    I was intending for the LNZ to be pasted onto some mixies because they do not breed true(They're too small and they have paintball eyes!).

                    I set these so that even though they have fixed personality values so they act like foxes, the rest of their traits are fully random so they will have unique personalities as well as a foxy one!
                    The original petz breeds do not have as many fully random traits. As of now the colors of their ears pass down weird. I will eventually have better files available for breeding, and all breeding
                    files will work with the foxes you adopt from this one!

                    To use this you just overwrite it onto any breed including dogz, adopt the pets, put the breed files back to normal, then breed!

                    I thought it'd be funny to make a big tough animal but then give it a chinchilla persian base. Their eyes sometimes do what that cub's eyes are doing.
                    Also, they are derpy in ways that I didn't want because I'm still learning how to hex.
